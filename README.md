Deck Of Cards
======
***Deck Of Cards*** is my first C# project.
In this App, the user is able to shuffle the deck or draw a number of cards from it.

On draw, the user is presented with the choice of sorting the drawn card. The sorting if made first by suite, then by face value with "A" being the highest.
